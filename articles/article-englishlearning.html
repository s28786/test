						🍀You are getting started studying English? You are looking for some
						appropriate methods to learn it effectively?🤔 Then, you should
						refer to the 8 following measures to be able to get started in the
						best and most productive way!!!😍
					</p>
					<h5>1. Finding inspiration</h5>
					<p>
						🍀People who are successful with learning English are also
						interested in English. It is not worth studying English when you are
						not enthusiastic about it.😥 Let’s find inspiration from the
						simplest things in your interests or life. How to find inspiration?
						Please look forward to the future sharing of Improve English!🤗
					</p>
					<h5>2. Get into the habit of "thinking" in English.</h5>
					<p>
						🍀We usually say or write something or think in Vietnamese and then
						translate it into English. However, that way of studying does not
						provide a quick reflex in communication. So, let’s learn to think in
						English from today.
					</p>
					<h5>3. Mistakes and corrections</h5>
					<p>
						🍀Even if you are a genius🧠, you will still fail and won't be able
						to succeed the first time. So it's normal to fail. 🍀The best way to
						face failure and error is to face them and overcome them. When you
						fail, you will learn more experiences and find out your faults. From
						it, you know what to do, what to change. Every time we fail, we
						improve ourselves so we won't repeat the old mistake. 😇 🍀So don't
						be afraid, bored, or disappointed in yourself.😊 Allow yourself to
						make mistakes, correct them, and make progress day by day.😉
					</p>
					<h5>4. Practice as more as possible</h5>
					<p>
						🍀Theory must go hand in hand with practice. Practice helps you
						review and grasp structures, vocabulary, or concepts,... easier.
						Start practicing from the simplest things in everyday life such as:
						Say hello✌ in English when meeting foreigners on the street. Join
						English clubs and participate in discussing favorite topics on
						foreign forums. Take advantage of situations to use English.
					</p>
					<h5>5. Don't read too many documents at the same time.</h5>
					<p>
						🍀You should focus on 1 to 2 appropriate documents or the one you
						feel receptive to. 🍀Find a new document after thoroughly practicing
						the old one.🙋 🍀Set a goal to avoid problems such as virtual
						efforts, toxic productivity,...
					</p>
					<h5>6. Find a partner to learn English with</h5>
					<p>
						🍀You may be very good at self-study, but English is hard to learn
						alone. You should have a companion to practice together. 🍀Studying
						with friends will help you improve your English skills, especially
						in fields that require reflexes and communication acumen. Besides,
						it also helps you learn to communicate English together, correct
						each other mistakes and remind each other to study. Furthermore,
						among a group actively competing with each other will motivate you
						to study every day.😚
					</p>
					<h5>7. Revision</h5>
					<p>
						🍀To have good results in studying vocabulary and grammar, you need
						to review class lessons and self-lessons. 🍀Review the notes in your
						class and try to memorize a few (if you can't learn many things at
						once) or better all the noticeable vocabulary and grammatical
						points.
